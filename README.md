Hello! I'm Gabriel (sometimes Syed), I study Computer Science at the Federal University of São Carlos, and I'm passionate about game development and high performance techniques. I have great experience with **C++** and passion for techniques and studies of deep **code optimization**.

I've also worked a lot with **Node.js (APIs)**, **Web/Mobile Development** and **Databases (SQL)**. In addition to using (a lot of) scripting languages such as **JavaScript** and **Lua** (the last one managed and integrated natively for use as a modding/scripting tool for *nanos world* game).

Currently working on https://github.com/nanos-world.
